# Measurement

The claim this project wants to make is not "four voice stacks are supported" —
that is a release gate, and it is met. It is **"here is what each one is worth,
measured the same way."**

That answer publishes continuously after launch, and it does not gate the
release. Shipping before the most interesting claims are provable is a
deliberate trade: a system nobody can run is not evidence of anything.

## What v1.0 claims

The README says what the system *supports* and what has been *verified*. It
makes no claim that one configuration beats another, and no such claim appears
anywhere until this program says so.

## Design

A reference configuration with paired cells changing exactly one factor each.
The full cross-product is infeasible and uninterpretable; a paired design is
what makes a difference attributable.

**Reference:** `cascade` · Qwen3-ASR · a local fast model · a hosted slow model
at high effort · Fish S2-Pro · 200 ms cadence · endpoint-only observation ·
audio observer only.

| | Factor | Levels | How it is set |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| F1 | Binding | cascade · omni-Qwen3 · omni-MiniCPM-o · duplex-Moshi · upstream | `-binding`, `-sidecar` |
| F2 | Cognition | fast-only · fast+slow · endpointed slow-only | `-rollout`, `-tool-progress` |
| F3 | Observers | audio · audio+video · video-only | `-observers` |
| F4 | Trigger cadence | 50 · 100 · 200 · 400 · 800 ms | `-trigger-cadence` |
| F5 | Floor source | engine floor · model-native | `-floor` |
| F6 | Slow model and effort | high · medium · local | `-slow-model`, `-slow-effort` |
| F7 | Observer components | keyframe+narration · narration-only · keyframe-only | `-observer-components` |
| F8 | Policy models | none · backchannel · turn projection · both | `-policy-models` |

Every factor is a command-line flag, because a policy that cannot be swapped
cannot be measured. A cell is a command line rather than a build.

F7 exists because the bundle is not uniformly good: a strong model can regress
when handed a keyframe stream, through image-token dilution. Shipping a default
without measuring its components per model would repeat a mistake the evidence
has already identified.

F8 answers the sizing question before the implementation is fixed: whether a
~3B policy model can actually make these calls, or whether ~8B is needed. The
policy-model client counts refusals — answers outside the enumerated list —
which is the signal that a model is too small for the job.

## Suites

| Suite | Scale | Answers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| τ-Voice | 278 tasks × control and regular speech | tool-use success under voice. F1, F2, F4, F5, F6 |
| FDB v1.5 | 498 overlap recordings | overlap, barge-in, turn-taking. F1, F5 |
| FDB v3 | 100 tool-use recordings | tool use with real function results. F1, F2 |
| FD-Bench | 6,147 conversations, 77.2 h | endpointing and timing at scale. F1, F4, F5 |
| DynaCU-Bench | 100 dynamic + 50 static | video observation, action grounding. F1, F3, F7 |

DynaCU-Bench stays in the AOI repository. OpenRealtime ships a runner and uses
it as a functional release gate — that video observation and action grounding
work end to end — not as a copied suite.

## Reporting rules

- **No incomplete cell is reported.** A partially executed cell is not a
  smaller result, it is a different one.
- **Every cell declares its source revision and executable hash.** A number
  that cannot be traced to a build is a number that will eventually be wrong.
- **Latency claims require distributions.** A mean first-audio latency without
  its tail describes a system nobody is using.
- **Negative results publish.** A configuration that does not help is
  information, and suppressing it is how a measured claim becomes a marketing
  claim.
- **No cross-suite synthesis.** τ-Voice and FD-Bench measure different things
  and do not average.

## What it cannot settle

Human preference and perceived naturalness. Those need a prospective protocol
with human raters, which is a separate program and not a re-analysis of these
numbers.

## Efficiency gates

These are release gates rather than comparative claims, and each has a
published number against a declared reference machine. See
[efficiency.md](efficiency.md).
