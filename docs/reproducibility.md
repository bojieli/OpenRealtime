# M0 reproducibility

M0 proves that a contributor can recreate a timing trace from a publicly
redistributable audio fixture before any engine optimization.

## Prerequisites

- A POSIX shell
- Go 1.25 or newer
- `curl` for the pinned specification provenance check

## One-command reproduction

From the repository root:

```bash
./scripts/reproduce_m0.sh
```

The script downloads Go modules, builds a trimmed production binary, verifies
the pinned official OpenAI schema extraction, regenerates the one-second WAV
into ignored `artifacts/`, replays it in 20 ms frames, validates every OpenAI
event plus whole-trace causality, compares all artifacts byte-for-byte with the
CC0 golden files, and runs race, test, vet, and formatting gates.

The canonical replay contains 50 OpenAI `input_audio_buffer.append` client
events followed by one `input_audio_buffer.commit` event. It starts at
monotonic time zero and commits at exactly 1,000,000,000 ns. The input is mono
PCM16 at the OpenAI-required 24 kHz rate, and each wire event carries standard
base64 audio.

## Manual commands

```bash
go build -trimpath -o artifacts/openrealtime ./cmd/openrealtime
artifacts/openrealtime fixture generate artifacts/m0-tone.wav
artifacts/openrealtime replay artifacts/m0-tone.wav \
  --events artifacts/m0-openai-events.jsonl \
  --trace artifacts/m0-trace.jsonl --session-id m0-replay --frame-ms 20
artifacts/openrealtime protocol validate \
  --profile realtime --direction client artifacts/m0-openai-events.jsonl
artifacts/openrealtime trace validate artifacts/m0-trace.jsonl
artifacts/openrealtime trace summarize artifacts/m0-trace.jsonl
```

The fixture is procedurally generated square-wave audio. It contains no speech,
personal data, imported recording, or synthesized voice. Its provenance and
license are recorded in [fixtures.md](fixtures.md).

## M1 endpointed reference condition

Run:

```bash
./scripts/reproduce_m1.sh
```

This command builds the production binary, rechecks the pinned official
protocol source, runs 30 seeded endpointed trials, validates every generated
trace, and compares the report, trial-0000 trace, and HTML timeline with the
checked reference artifacts. It then runs the same race, vet, and formatting
gates as M0. See [m1-baseline.md](m1-baseline.md) for the stage equation,
reported distribution, and limitations.

## M2 cadence ablation

Run:

```bash
./scripts/reproduce_m2.sh
```

The command regression-checks all M1 reference traces, then regenerates the six
paired M2 scheduling conditions, complete action ledger, and HTML ablation
view. It compares the report and visualization byte-for-byte and runs the full
race, test, vet, and formatting gates. See [m2-engine.md](m2-engine.md) for the
attribution equation and interpretation limits.
